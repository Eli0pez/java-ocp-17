## üîß Pull Request Steps
You can see your code reflected as soon as you save the code by running a server. Don't miss adding test cases and then make green rights.

#### Run webpack-dev-server
If testing of legacy browsers is required, the development server can still be run using a [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).

``` sh
$ npm run serve:ie editor
```

#### Run test

``` sh
$ npm test editor
```
